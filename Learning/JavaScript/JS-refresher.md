- [Introduction](#introduction)

#### Introduction

- It is `weakly typed programming language` which means that we have no explicit type assignment.
- Data types can be switched dynamically means you can convert number to text.
- `Object oriented language` means that data can be organized in logical objects.
- `Primitive and reference type`

  - Primitive type values are : `String`,`Number`,`Boolean`, `Undefined`, `Null` and `Symbol` (introducted in ES6)
  - `Primitive type` values are copied by value
  - `Primitive type` values are stored in `Stack`
  - Stack is a small (limited in space) and fast memory and it does not hold more data
  - Reference type value are `Objects` such as `Array`
  - `Reference type` values are copied by value reference
  - `Reference type` values are stored in `Heap`
  - Heap can hold more data that changes dynamically. Therefore, it is slow

- It is a `Versatile language` that runs in browser on a PC/server and can be used to do broad variety of tasks such as listen to user events in browser, rerender the DOM, work with files, databases etc.
